## Summary
I have always been attracted by "creating" professions, such as teachers, doctors, engineers, because they profoundly change quality of life for a large amount of people.  
I believe that helping others and contributing to society is a worthy pursuit. 
Besides, I have always enjoyed solving various problems and optimizing processes.   
That's why after six years in retail, I decided to realize this need and become a developer.

Developed a web app to optimize dog walking for my neighbors, using computer science to enhance daily life and community efficiency.
